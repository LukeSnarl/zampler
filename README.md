## Quick and dirty sample player.

This is designed to run locally on an old laptop or something, plugged into a DJ mixer, to allow you to inject airhorns and other dumb sound samples into your set, without having to bother with getting hold of [special hardware](https://www.akaipro.com/mpx-8.html).

Copy the `ZAMPLER` folder somewhere on your computer - bung some `.WAV` files in the `set` folders within the `samples` folder.

They must be named `1.wav`, `2.wav` up to `8.wav`

Set folders must be named `set1`, `set2` up to `set4`

Drag the `index.html` file into your browser

Click on the buttons on screen to play the sounds - or press keys `1`-`8`. Also `arrow up` and `arrow down` change sets...

enjoy

PS i certainly don't hold the copyright for the samples in this repo - there are purely there as examples for demonstration purposes of the functionality and should be deleted by anyone who downloads this repo for their own use.

PPS as for sample format - ANY `.WAV` file that the HTML <audio> tag will play should work...
